Using ftp client:

After doing a "get" command on the ftp client, the server will no longer accommodate another command that uses pasv mode (another get or nlist).
The ftp client prints out "Can't parse time `Closing data connection'.".

Can't seem to understand why the ftp client needs time on the 226 response when the RFC doesn't even mention it.
In order to test the other commands please restart the ftp server and client or to just test the "get" last.

Using netcat:

All the commands were tested in netcat to ensure the proper workflow of messages

After starting a get command, which opens a data connection, once the file or image is transferred to the client,
please enter "quit" on the client side and re-connect to the server.

You can also try to test the functionality (PASV, NLST, RETR) with nc <ip> <port>, where the RETR command successfully transfers
the file and the data connection closes upon transfer completion. You just need to have two client windows open, one to issue
the commands and a second to make the data connection.

* First make clean && make
* Then to start running the server, run "./ftpserver <port number here>"
* Login using USER command with "username"
* To connect to the server's port, in a separate window use "nc <ip of ftp server> <port number of ftp server>" (if you are running on the same computer use "localhost" as the ftp server ip address
* To make a data connection, enter PASV and the IP and port number info will be returned, then in a separate window make a data connection using nc again
* Then you can make NLST and RETR commands once data connection opened (one data connection per command)

This FTP server supports these commands: (Please look at RFC 959: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc959 for detailed info of commands)
* USER - (4.1.1)
* QUIT - (4.1.1)
* CWD  - (4.1.1) For security reasons the FTP server doesn't accept any CWD command that starts with ./ or ../ or contains ../ in it.
* CDUP - (4.1.1) For security reasons the FTP server doesn't allow a CDUP command to set the working directory to be the parent directory of where your ftp server is started from.
* TYPE - (4.1.1) Only supports the Image and ASCII type (3.1.1, 3.1.1.3)
* MODE - Only supports Stream mode (3.4.1)
* STRU - Only supports File structure type (3.1.2, 3.1.2.1)
* RETR - (4.1.3)
* PASV - (4.1.1)
* NLST - (4.1.3)
